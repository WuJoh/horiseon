# Horiseon Refactor Code

## Description
In this version of the Horiseon homepage I updated the codebase to follow accessibility guidelines and standards. When you view the soucre code you will find sematic HTML elements and there is elements that follow the structure of styling and positioning. As well as when viewing the image elements you will find alt attributes which will describe in details the photo. The title of the element is consise and descriptive. It will follow the mockup that was previously attached as well.
